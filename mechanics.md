# Mechanics

## Classic platformer mechanics
Main movement occurs in on a 2d plane with platforms. The player can jump on the platforms in order to obtain objectives or avoid enemies and obstacles.

### Our spin on the life system
Our life system is based on a finite number of smaller versions of the player character that follow the player throughout the games progression.
These smaller versions of the player character aren't as capable of climbing through obstacles and jumping as the player. Thus, the player must in a sense, guide them through each level and help them by, for example, moving crates.
